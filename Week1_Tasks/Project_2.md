# Project Proposal: Packaging FLINT for Cross-Platform Usage

## Introduction
FLINT is a modern programming language designed for writing secure smart contracts efficiently. However, its usage is currently limited by platform dependencies. This project aims to package FLINT for cross-platform compatibility, enabling developers to utilize FLINT across various operating systems seamlessly.

## Objectives
1. *Study FLINT*: Gain a comprehensive understanding of FLINT's architecture, features, and dependencies ([FLINT Guide](https://github.com/flintlang/flint-2/blob/master/docs/guide.md)).
2. *Follow FLINT Developer Tutorial*: Utilize the official FLINT Developer tutorial to familiarize yourself with FLINT's development process ([FLINT Developer Tutorial](https://github.com/flintlang/flint-2/blob/master/docs/guide.md)).
3. *Setup Development Environment*: Configure a development environment according to FLINT's requirements, ensuring compatibility with multiple platforms ([FLINT Guide](https://github.com/flintlang/flint-2/blob/master/docs/guide.md)).
4. *Formulate Release Process Plan*: Develop a detailed plan outlining the steps needed to package FLINT for cross-platform usage.

## Expected Deliverables
1. *Release Process Plan Document*: A comprehensive document detailing the steps necessary to package FLINT for cross-platform usage, including dependencies, adjustments, testing, documentation, and release schedule.
2. *Cross-Platform FLINT Package*: A packaged version of FLINT that is tested and functional across different operating systems.
3. *Documentation*: Clear and concise documentation covering installation instructions, troubleshooting tips, and platform-specific considerations for using FLINT.
